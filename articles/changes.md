*Changes* is a jazz album released by **Keith Jarrett**, **Jack DeJohnette** and **Gary Peacock** in 1984. This group subsequently became known as the "Standards Trio". The album features improvised compositions recorded at the same sessions as the two volumes released as *Standards* in Januari 1983, New York. In 2008 the three albums were collected into a single boxed set, *Setting Standards: New York Sessions*.

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars, stating, "Unlike the other two Keith Jarrett trio recordings from January 1983, this collaboration with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack DeJohnette does not feature standards. The trio performs the 30-minute *Flying* and a 6-minute *Prism* both of them Jarrett originals. *Flying* which has several sections, keeps one's interest throughout while the more concise *Prism* has a beautiful melody. It is a nice change to hear Jarrett (who normally plays unaccompanied) interacting with a trio of superb players.".
