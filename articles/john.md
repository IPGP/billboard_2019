# _**John Lennon**_

![Cover](articles/lennon.png)

Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity
Hospital, to Julia (née Stanley) (1914–1958) and Alfred
Lennon (1912–1976). Alfred was a merchant seaman of Irish
descent who was away at the time of his son s birth.
His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal
grandfather, John Jack Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston
Churchill. His father was often away from home but sent
regular pay cheques to 9 Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where
Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when
he went absent without leave in February 1944. When
he eventually came home six months later, he offered to
look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with
another man s child, rejected the idea. After her sister
Mimi complained to Liverpool s Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon s father
visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending
to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed
them—with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins—and
after a heated argument his father forced the five-year-old
to choose between them. Lennon twice chose his father,
but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed
her, although this has been disputed. According to author
Mark Lewisohn, Lennon s parents agreed that Julia should
take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness
who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic
scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to
make a decision between his parents never happened.
It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father
again.
