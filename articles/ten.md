Ten is the debut studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, released on
August 27, 1991 through Epic Records. Following the disbanding of bassist Jeff
Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's previous group Mother Love Bone, the two
recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder, guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave
Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams,
to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness, and
abuse.

Ten was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on
the Billboard 200 chart. The album produced three hit singles: "Alive", "Even
Flow", and "Jeremy". While Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge
bandwagon at the time—despite the fact that Ten had been both recorded and
released before Nirvana's Nevermind—Ten was instrumental in popularizing
alternative rock in the mainstream. In February 2013, the album crossed the
10 million mark in sales, becoming the 22nd one to do so in the Nielsen
SoundScan era and has been certified 13× platinum by the RIAA. It remains
Pearl Jam's most commercially successful album.
